## Installation

Node and MySQL should be installed first.

You can download the latest version of Node from [here](https://nodejs.org/). Get MySQL Community Server [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/).

Once you have installed both, download [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) and run the queries in schema.sql and seeds.sql.

Then install the inquirer, mysql and console.table libraries by typing the following commands in the terminal:

`npm install express`
